//TO-DO

* Delete copy constructor and assignment operator in the necessary files of the project
  e.g.:
    // no copy
    MyClass(const MyClass&) = delete;
    // no assign
    MyClass& operator=(const MyClass&) = delete;
* Fix: When changing the size of the screen during runtime, controls start to work incorrectly
* List all third-party modules (in the command line) while starting the engine
